Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository
Introduction
The Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository project aims to provide a Python script that enables users to clone an original repository, create a forked repository, and synchronize the forked repository with the changes made in the original repository.

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements of the Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository project, serving as a guide for development and testing.

Stakeholders
Developers: The individuals responsible for developing the Python script and maintaining the project.
Users: Individuals who will use the script to clone and synchronize repositories.

Functional Requirements
The script shall provide a GUI window for user interaction.
The GUI window shall include the following fields:
GitHub Access Token: A text field for users to enter their GitHub access token.
Original Repository to be Forked: A text field for users to enter the URL of the original repository.
Your GitHub web URL: A text field for users to enter their GitHub web URL.
Local PC Folder for Clone: A text field for users to enter the local folder path for cloning repositories.
Ok Button: A button to initiate the clone and sync operation.
Test Button: A button to perform a test without making any changes.
The script shall validate the repository URLs entered by the user.
The script shall display an error message if any required field is left empty.
The script shall display an error message if the entered repository URLs are invalid.
The script shall clone the original repository to the local machine using the Git command-line.
The script shall create a forked repository using the user's GitHub web URL.
The script shall synchronize the forked repository with the changes made in the original repository.
The script shall display a message box showing the details of the clone and sync operation.
The script shall clear the input fields after the clone and sync operation is completed.

Non-functional Requirements
Usability:
The GUI window shall have a user-friendly layout and design.
The script shall provide clear instructions and error messages to guide users.
Performance:
The script shall perform the clone and sync operation efficiently, minimizing execution time.
Portability:
The script shall be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
Reliability:
The script shall handle errors and exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to users.
The script shall handle network interruptions and recover gracefully.
Maintainability:
The code shall be well-structured and documented to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.
The script shall follow best practices and coding standards to ensure readability and maintainability.

Constraints
The script requires Python 3.x and Git (command-line) to be installed on the user's machine.
The script assumes the user has a valid GitHub account and access token.
The script relies on the availability and stability of the GitHub API for repository synchronization.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository Python script:

Git: The Git version control system must be installed on the local machine. It is used for cloning repositories and performing git operations. You can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/

Python 3: The Python programming language is required to run the script. Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/

Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for Python. It is used to create the graphical user interface for the script. Tkinter is typically included with the Python installation, so no additional installation steps are required.

Git Bash (Windows only): If you are using Windows, it is recommended to have Git Bash installed. Git Bash provides a Unix-like command-line environment that is compatible with the script. You can download Git Bash as part of the Git for Windows package: https://gitforwindows.org/

PyGithub: The PyGithub library is used to interact with the GitHub API. It is used to create forks and perform repository-related operations. You can install PyGithub using pip: [pip install PyGithub]

Regular Expression (re): The regular expression module in Python, re, is used for validating the repository URLs. It is a standard library and should be included with your Python installation.

Please ensure that all the above dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository script.

Note: The script assumes that the required commands (git, python) are accessible from the command-line environment. Ensure that the corresponding executables are added to the system's PATH variable.

If you encounter any issues related to missing dependencies or compatibility, refer to the official documentation and installation guides for each dependency.
Future Enhancements
Support for additional version control systems (e.g., Bitbucket, GitLab).
Enhancements to the GUI for improved user experience.
Integration with other development tools or services.

Conclusion
This requirements document provides a clear overview of the functional and non-functional requirements for the Fork, Clone, and Sync Repository project. By adhering to these requirements, the development team can ensure that the resulting Python script meets the needs of the users and stakeholders. The script aims to provide a user-friendly interface for cloning and synchronizing repositories, with considerations for usability, performance, portability, reliability, and maintainability. Additionally, the document outlines the project's dependencies, constraints, and potential future enhancements. With this requirements document as a guide, the development and testing processes can proceed effectively to deliver a high-quality solution.
